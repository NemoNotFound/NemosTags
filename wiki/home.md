# Description
**Nemo’s Tags** is a utility mod that adds a variety of new tags to improve mod compatibility and enhance how Minecraft handles custom content.
This helps ensure that items, blocks, tools, and more from different mods can work together more seamlessly.

In addition to new tags, **Nemo’s Tags** also modifies and extends parts of Minecraft’s internal logic to make it more flexible and modder-friendly.
