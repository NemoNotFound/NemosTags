# Add Custom Shears

To add custom shears, simply add your shears item to the `shears` item tag.  
Your shears will now be able to destroy and retrieve leaves.

**Fabric only:**  
This will also allow your shears to be used on **beehives**, **bogged**, **mushroom cows**, **sheep**, and **snow golems**.

**Note:**  
For your shears to work with a dispenser, you need to register them manually.

# Add Custom Buckets

## Milk a Cow/Goat
To milk a cow or goat, simply:
- Add your empty bucket item to the `empty_buckets` item tag
- Add a key-value pair (empty bucket â†’ milk bucket) to the `BUCKET_TO_MILK_BUCKET` map

## Empty Buckets
The logic for emptying buckets has been updated to check if the filled bucket is in the `FILLED_BUCKET_TO_EMPTY_BUCKET` map and retrieve the corresponding empty bucket value.  
To make your custom bucket empty, simply add your filled bucket to the `FILLED_BUCKET_TO_EMPTY_BUCKET` map.

**Note:**
- To make your custom buckets interact with cauldrons, check out the `CauldronInteraction` class.
- To make your custom water buckets able to pick up entities, you will need to adapt their logic manually.
